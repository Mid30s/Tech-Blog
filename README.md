## Description

The Tech Blog Project is a full-stack web application designed to provide users with a platform to share their thoughts and experiences related to the ever-evolving field of technology. This project aims to create a user-friendly and interactive environment where users can create, edit, and delete posts while engaging with others through comments.

During the development of this project, I encountered numerous challenges that tested my skills and understanding of web development concepts. These problems ranged from rendering content dynamically to implementing user authentication and managing comments. Through perseverance and a systematic approach, I managed to overcome these obstacles, ultimately resulting in a functional and visually appealing Tech Blog.

One of the most significant problems I faced was dynamically rendering the number of comments associated with a particular post. This issue persisted in multiple views, such as the dashboard and the edit post pages. To resolve this, I leveraged the power of Handlebars.js, a templating engine, to create custom helpers and partials that efficiently displayed the desired information. By learning how to utilize Handlebars.js effectively, I was able to enhance the project's overall functionality and user experience.

Another challenge I encountered was implementing a delete feature for user-generated comments. This feature required the proper identification and association of user IDs with their corresponding comments. Through the creation of custom Handlebars helpers and careful consideration of the data flow, I ensured that the delete button was only visible to the user who created the comment. This addition greatly improved the user's ability to manage their content, contributing to the overall user experience.

User authentication was also a crucial aspect of this project, ensuring that only authorized users had access to specific features and content. By using express-session and middleware functions, I was able to create a secure and robust authentication system that protected user data and maintained the integrity of the platform.

Throughout this project, I learned a great deal about full-stack web development, including working with databases, routing, and front-end frameworks. I gained valuable experience in organizing code, debugging, and finding creative solutions to the challenges I faced. This project also helped me deepen my understanding of user experience and the importance of creating a responsive and intuitive interface.

In conclusion, the Tech Blog Project served as an incredible learning experience, pushing me to expand my skills and knowledge in full-stack web development. By solving various problems and continuously refining the application, I not only created a functional and user-friendly platform but also grew as a developer. With each challenge overcome, the Tech Blog Project became a testament to my dedication, resilience, and passion for web development.
